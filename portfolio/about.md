Technology Leader & Educator 

## Who I Am

I currently serve as the *Technology Director* for Haystack Mountain School Crafts where I have two key responsibilities: 

**Fab Lab Program Director** — I oversee and direct  Fab Lab at Haystack, which is a initiative within Haystack to facilitate more research and experimenting using the resources and network of the Fab Lab. 

**IT & System Administrator** — I manage the technology infrastructure for the school. Over the past five years, I've built a comprehensive system to help bring the organization into the 21st century and adopt modern digital and cloud platforms. 

I've worked most of my professional career bridging the gap between technical and non-technical worlds. I've established myself as a leader and expert in technology from a social, organizational, and educational perspective. I enjoy getting into weeds with a subject or problem, and unpacking it until it makes sense. As a result, I've learned a lot of different topics, subjects, and skills. I not only enjoy learning and making new things, but also teaching mentoring, and collaborating with people. My work has always been associated with some aspect of community and collaboration.  


I value transparency and  honesty when it comes to my work, brining patience and compassionate and empathy for how overwhelming, frustrating and

**Systems & IT Administrator** — I've been around computers and technology all of my life. My dad was a computer systems engineer, and as a result, I was surrounded by early-internet era computers. I loved to tinker with them and learn how they work. In all phases of my personal and professional life, everywhere I have worked, I have always been somewhat responsible for and engaged with some type of IT and systems administration. It wasn't until recently that I became the Technology Director for Haystack and became actually responsible for running a moderate-sized organization's IT infrastructure that I rediscovered my passion for computer systems. 






Fab Labs 

I'm a technology translator who helps people and organizations make sense of the digital world without the overwhelm. My background is unconventional—I have deep technical knowledge from years of hacking on computers and building everything from websites to Arduino projects, combined with a genuine appreciation for traditional crafts and hands-on making. What I love most is being the bridge between complex technical concepts and practical solutions that actually work for real people. Whether I'm helping an artist design something on the computer, showing an organization how to streamline their workflows, or teaching someone to 3D print their first prototype, I get energized by those moments when something clicks and people realize they can control their digital tools instead of being controlled by them.



## A brief history 

### Undergraduate: Electrical & Computer System Engineering ('06-'10)

I went to UMass Amherst for Electrical & Computer System Engineering. Technically, I was in Electrical Engineering, but they forced us to take computer system courses and learn to code. 

As a musician for most of my youth, I went into the programing thinking that I would become a specialized Audio Engineer, with a proper Electrical Engineering degree, perhaps developing custom high-end boutique hardware for recording studios, or developing a recording studio myself. I even got to start a student-run recording studio for a brief period of time, which ultimately opened my eyes to realities of music recording professionally. I didn't like it. But, I did like making hardware, and I was introduced to several DIY audio electronics projects, books, and something called an Arduino was just starting to become popular. I pivoted my focus to more DIY/maker projects that were related to people - either making beginning electronics tutorials or creative electronic projects with artists. I loved operating in the space that still felt relatable and accessible, *folk electronics* is what I had heard it referred to as. 

At a certain point in college, I realized that I was not cut out to be a "real" engineer. Most of my friends were on path to get conventional industry jobs, and this really did not appeal to me. After nearly dropping out of the engineering school and switching majors, I realized that there was a space for my to occupy and a nonconventional path for me to take. I decided to view my engineering education as an asset, but not my complete identity. I was interested in other important topics, like sustainability and the environment, philosophy and education. I explored other domains, communities and aspects. Being a muscian throughout college helped as well. I was mostly living and surrounding myself with non-engineers, and as a result, I would often have to describe what I do to people that understood nothing about what I was learning. 


### Post-college: Americorps VISTA & AS220 ('10-'14)

Entering the workforce during a recession was not great. I did not find a creative job in the engineering field, not for lack of trying, but my advisor made a life changing recommendation to me that has led to where I am today. He told me about these spaces called hackerspaces and makerspaces, and even told me about one in Providence, RI that has an Americorps VISTA position opened. It was AS220, and the role at the time was to become the Fab Lab coordinator, and develop a brand new experimental program. 

This is where I discovered the newly established Fab Lab network, a spinoff from MIT's Center for Bits & Atoms, started by Neil Gershenfeld. I knew almost immediately that I had found the community I was looking for. Fab Labs were/are spaces that combine many different technologies and displcines all together under one roof - not only electronics and computers, but also fabrication machines that can make physical objects. This was new to me since Engineering School at UMass was very silhoed, we did not learn about anything really outside of the domain of electronics and computer systems, or coding. Officioally at least. 


After graduating with my electrical engineering degree, I made what many would consider an unusual choice: instead of taking a high-paying corporate job, I became an AmeriCorps VISTA working for AS220, a community arts organization in Providence, Rhode Island. I became their Fab Lab coordinator and discovered this whole world I didn't know existed—the MIT Fab Lab network, digital fabrication, and a global community of people actually making real things you could touch and feel.

At AS220, I learned that running community programming is really, really hard, but also incredibly rewarding. I wore many hats: recruiting teachers, developing course catalogs, teaching workshops, taking on commission work. I definitely made some mistakes—like the time I changed the aspect ratio on ping pong paddles for a client project without telling them, which taught me valuable lessons about communication and valuing my time. But I also fell in love with this holistic approach to making that combined computer design, prototyping, electronics, and coding all in one.

What I loved about AS220? What Did I learn? 

AS220 challenged me to really step outside of highly technical space, like my engineering school, and interact with people from all different levels and backgrounds. Yes, there were super geeky members who spoke the same language, but there were also printmakers and photographers and artists that were curious but knew nothing about electronics. It really pushed and challenged me to explore myself as a communicator and educator. 

I had to learn how to lead, despite having a lot of failures, I failed quickly and often as the saying goes. But working here eventually burned me out. It's a tough workplace and the organization was undergoing to internal and financial challenges that added to the stress of my job. 

After four years, two as a VISTA and two as the Labs Manager, I stepped away. 


### Graduate School: UVA (2014-2019)
After AS220, my now-wife and I decided to move out of Providence. We did not have any real plans, which I am sure both our parents felt great about. We packed up our volvo station wagon - which has the type of seats that perfectly recline into a flat section, great for sleeping, and we set out on a cross country adventure to do some soul searching and discover ourselves. 

We spent about 6 months on the road. We actually stayed in Maine for two months, I got a consulting gig from a non-profit starting a makerspace, but then we kept on moving and exploring. During a stop in Charlottesville, Virginia, to visit family, I happened to read about a UVA professor who had just landed a major NSF grant to integrate digital fabrication into local schools. I reached out purely out of curiosity, and that professor, Dr. Glen Bull, ended up hiring me—but only if I enrolled in graduate school to get my PhD.

So I did. For five years, I worked on developing educational STEM kits that recreated historic American inventions like the telegraph, electric motor, and battery. It was a partnership program with the Smithsonian, and was a really exciting project to work on throughout my graduate school experience. In graduate school, I learened a lot of new skills. Like how to read research. How to write properly. I learned more about philisophy, and thinking, and making sense, and how people learn and make sense. It was actually really fascinating and felt like it filled some gap in my brain that was missing some critical thinking skills that engineering school never fully developed. 

Graduate school taught me how to think critically, write effectively, and understand how knowledge is constructed. But more importantly, it reinforced my belief that the best learning happens when people can build, break, and rebuild things with their own hands.

### Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, 2019-Present
In my final year at UVA, I was invited to Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine to run their high school internship program. They offered me a job as their first-ever Fab Lab Coordinator, and I've been there ever since, now as Technology Director.

At Haystack, I've gotten to experiment with cutting-edge digital fabrication tools while working with incredibly talented artists. I developed "Haystack Labs," our Fab Lab residency program that brings together traditional craft makers and digital technologists. But equally important, I've been helping the organization transition from being primarily paper-driven to modern, cloud-first operations.

This work has helped me realize what I really love: making technology accessible and solving real problems for people who aren't necessarily "tech people." Whether it's helping a small nonprofit streamline their operations or showing an artist how to integrate digital tools into their practice, I'm energized by helping people feel empowered by technology rather than intimidated by it.


## My Values & Philosophy

### Systems Thinking, Human Scale
I'm drawn to understanding how things work at a foundational level. I like to build from primitive components and add complexity thoughtfully, rather than starting with abstractions I don't understand. But I'm also deeply committed to working at human scale—with small nonprofits, individual artists, family shops. I believe the best solutions are the ones people can actually maintain and afford long-term.

### Making the Complex Accessible
Technology shouldn't be intimidating or exploitative. I hate the idea of people using esoteric knowledge to intentionally confuse customers and charge more money. I'd rather demystify things and make them as simple and accessible as possible. Everyone deserves to feel comfortable with the digital tools in their life.

### Hands-On Learning
People learn best when they can touch, build, break, and rebuild things. This guides everything I do, whether I'm teaching a workshop or helping an organization implement new systems. We learn by doing, not just by talking about it.

### Community and Connection
Throughout my career, I've seen how powerful technology becomes when it's used to build and strengthen communities. From artist collaborations in Fab Labs to helping rural schools access modern tools, technology's greatest impact comes through fostering human connections.

### Continuous Curiosity
I've been building websites since my family had dial-up internet, working my way through everything from GeoCities to modern web development. I love testing out new tools and evaluating their quality, but I'm not loyal to any particular software company. I'll use whatever makes the most sense for the person or organization I'm working with.

### Preparing for an Uncertain Future
The world is going through major transitions—climate change, AI, economic shifts. Rural communities especially risk being left behind. I'm passionate about building resilience through accessible technology education and helping people develop dynamic skills for a changing workforce. Digital fabrication excites me because it brings together so many domains and can lead to real economic opportunities.
