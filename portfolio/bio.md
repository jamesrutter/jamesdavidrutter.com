"Tech Therapist & Digital Architect"



## The Tech Therapist
I keep coming back to this idea that my role and specialization is to make people more comfortable with technology. I like to get into the weeds with new things, break things, and put them back together in a logical way that could be 

"a blend of a strategic technology leader, innovative builder, and an empowering educator. You bridge the gap between complex tech and real-world human needs."


## The Engineer 
I like to build things, both physically and digitally. Lately, I have been building more digital things (like websites, web apps, tools and utilities). However, I have been messing around with Arduinos for the past 15 years and have built all sorts of projects for myself and for others.



## A story about me... 
My name is James Rutter. 

I am 37 years old and live in Stonington, Maine. 

I went to undergrad for Electrical & Computer System Engineering, thinking that I would become an Audio Engineer but discovered and become obsessed with DIY electronics, like Arduinos. I moved away from audio engineering and music and into the world of digital fabrication and technology writ large. 

In university, I worked for a student-run makerspace, called M5, and help build tutorial projects, documentation, etc. Upon graduating, I had an opportunity to become an AmeriCorps VISTA working for a community arts organization with a budding makerspace program, AS220, and AS220 Labs. There I worked for about 4 years, and developed a robust makerspace/digital fabrication center (Fab Lab), interacted with the MIT / Fab Foundation network of Fab Labs, and worked with artists to use technology to make things. I got to learn a lot about design and fabrication, and how to make physical things, not just electronics and code. Combining these skills allowed for a whole new world of projects and allowed me to tackle really exciting projects and collaborations. 

I was invited up to Haystack Mountain School of Crafts to be a technical assistant in the Lab for a summer program, and then was invited back to teach a series of community-based workshops during the winter with the local community. 

Eventually, I would go back to grad school, attending the University of Virginia Charlottesville, VA. I worked with Dr. Glen Bull in the K-12 Center for Advanced Manufacturing and the Make to Learn group. I developed educational kits that introducted digital fabrication and engineering into the formal K-12 curriculum. I worked with many of the local schools and teachers, piloting kits and projects. After about 5 years working here and studying, I would earn my Ph.D. in STEM Education (technically my degree was in the Curriculum & Instruction department, but it had originated in Instructional Technology and focused closely on STEM Education). 

In my final year, I was invited back up to Haystack to work for a summer program, running the high school internship for a session (two week program) and then was offered a job as the first-ever Fab Lab Coordinator for the school. I joined in 2019 and am still working there today, now Technology Director, I oversee not just the Fab Lab but the entirety of the school's technology systems and operations. While distinct form the world of digital fabrication and Fab Labs/makerspaces, my role as Technology Directory has allowed me to re-discover my passion for technology, and developing modern tools and solutions for our organization to help with operations and transition the organization that was primarily paper-driven/analog when I arrived, into a cloud-first modern operations and workflows. I've taken on several large-scale projects, both within the Fab Lab, developing new innovative programs, such as "Haystack Labs", our Fab Lab Residency program, and a robust set of community programs focused on STEAM education and empowring the local community with the tools of the Fab Lab. I am also trying to empower and improve the operations of the Organization by intergrating and adopting modern SaaS tools to build custo bespoke solutions. 

I have always been a maker and tinkerer. I've been building websites since I got my family had a dial-up internet connection and a computer in the house. Geopages, Dreamweaver, static HTML/CSS/JS, Wordpress, and now I've re-discovered the modern landscape of web development and have fallen in love with building for the browser. Browsers are so powerful nowadays, and we use them to run so much. I love loveraging the this to build things and see how it can be used to solve problems.

## Conversational 

> Hi, I’m James Rutter. I help organizations—from non-profits to small businesses—take control of their technology so they can spend less time wrestling with tech and more time making an impact. My journey started as an engineer, but I quickly realized how frustrating, alienating, and disconnected so many people feel about technology and digital systems. At Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, I get to experiment with cutting-edge digital fabrication tools, work with talented artists, and try new ideas—and I want to share that knowledge and experience with others.
>
> I also hold a Ph.D. in STEM Education from the University of Virginia, which helped me develop a framework for how to break down complex ideas and provide clear direction and strategies. I bring together my unique experiences and perspectives by combining my love for technology, data, and creative and collaborative problem-solving. I approach technology as more than just software and hardware; for me, it's about building systems with a human heart.
