## Domains 
- **Web & Application Development.** I much prefer and am more knowledgeable developing web apps versus native apps. That said, I have used Tauri to make native apps on macOS and iOS. 
- Information Technology, Computers, and Networking 


## Web & App Development (aka Software and Coding )
### Programming Languages

*Fluent*
HTML
CSS
JavaScript 
TypeScript 
Python 
Bash 
SQL 

*Comfortable*
C++ 
Rust 
Go 

### Platforms 
Linux: VPS, Proxmox, Raspberry Pi 

Cloudflare 
AWS 
Google Cloud Platform 

Coolify (self-hosting)


### Frameworks 
In order of preference: 
- Astro 
- SvelteKit
- Nuxt
- Tauri 
- Next 

Svelte is my preferred front-end javascript library. The svelte compiler makes for super performant frontends and it aligns with web standards. 

### Data & Persistence  
Postgres
Supabase
Sqlite, libSQL 
Cloudflare R2 

### Auth 
Supabase Auth 
Google OAuth
