## Technology Director & Digital Fabrication Expert

I'm James Rutter, Ph.D., and I help organizations and communities harness the power of digital fabrication, educational technology, and modern systems to create meaningful change.

### What I Do

**Technology Transformation**  
I guide organizations through digital transformation, helping them move from outdated systems to cloud-first solutions that reduce overhead and increase efficiency. At Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, I led a complete organizational transformation that reduced administrative overhead by 60%.

**Digital Fabrication & Fab Labs**  
I design and develop digital fabrication programs that connect international artists and educators with cutting-edge technology. Through "Haystack Labs," I've created residency programs that bridge traditional crafts with modern digital tools.

**STEAM Education**  
I develop curriculum and educational programs that make engineering and technology accessible to learners of all ages. My work spans K-12 schools, community programs, and professional development for educators.

### Current Focus

- **Digital Transformation Consulting** for non-profits and small businesses
- **Community STEAM Education** programs in rural Maine
- **Fab Lab Network Development** and international collaboration
- **Modern Web Development** and cloud-first solutions
- **AI Integration** for educational and organizational applications

### Background

With a Ph.D. in STEM Education from the University of Virginia and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from UMass Amherst, I bring both technical expertise and educational insight to every project. I'm a Fab Academy graduate and have been working at the intersection of technology and education for over a decade.

From building one of Rhode Island's first Fab Labs at AS220 to leading technology initiatives at an internationally recognized craft school, I've helped organizations and communities embrace digital tools while maintaining their core mission and values.

### Let's Connect

Whether you're looking to transform your organization's technology infrastructure, develop innovative educational programs, or explore the possibilities of digital fabrication, I'd love to discuss how we can work together.
