# About James Rutter

Backstory – 2–3 pivotal transitions (engineer → maker → tech director).


## Who I Am

I'm a technology translator who helps people and organizations make sense of the digital world without the overwhelm. My background is unconventional—I have deep technical knowledge from years of hacking on computers and building everything from websites to Arduino projects, combined with a genuine appreciation for traditional crafts and hands-on making. What I love most is being the bridge between complex technical concepts and practical solutions that actually work for real people. Whether I'm helping an artist design something on the computer, showing an organization how to streamline their workflows, or teaching someone to 3D print their first prototype, I get energized by those moments when something clicks and people realize they can control their digital tools instead of being controlled by them.

## My Story

My professional journey has been anything but linear, and honestly, that's been the best part.

### The Audio Engineering Detour (College Years)
I started college thinking I'd become an audio engineer. I was in a band throughout most of school, gigging around the Boston area and Western Mass, collecting audio gear, and recording friends. I even convinced my undergraduate advisor to let me start a student-run recording studio in the basement of the engineering department. But somewhere along the way, I realized that recording musicians professionally wasn't really for me. I discovered Arduino projects and got obsessed with this idea of physical computing—building circuits that could sense the environment and using code to process that information. It was like combining the physical and digital worlds in ways that felt creative and expressive.

### The Community Arts Awakening (AS220, 2010-2014)
After graduating with my electrical engineering degree, I made what many would consider an unusual choice: instead of taking a high-paying corporate job, I became an AmeriCorps VISTA working for AS220, a community arts organization in Providence, Rhode Island. I became their Fab Lab coordinator and discovered this whole world I didn't know existed—the MIT Fab Lab network, digital fabrication, and a global community of people actually making real things you could touch and feel.

At AS220, I learned that running community programming is really, really hard, but also incredibly rewarding. I wore many hats: recruiting teachers, developing course catalogs, teaching workshops, taking on commission work. I definitely made some mistakes—like the time I changed the aspect ratio on ping pong paddles for a client project without telling them, which taught me valuable lessons about communication and valuing my time. But I also fell in love with this holistic approach to making that combined computer design, prototyping, electronics, and coding all in one.

### The Academic Detour (University of Virginia, 2014-2019)
After AS220, my now-wife and I decided to do something completely spontaneous. We moved into our 2002 Volvo station wagon and lived out of the car for several months, traveling around the US with no real plan. During a stop in Charlottesville, Virginia, to visit family, I happened to read about a UVA professor who had just landed a major NSF grant to integrate digital fabrication into local schools. I reached out purely out of curiosity, and that professor, Dr. Glen Bull, ended up hiring me—but only if I enrolled in graduate school to get my PhD.

So I did. For five years, I worked on developing educational kits that recreated historic American inventions like the telegraph, electric motor, and battery. These weren't just history lessons—they were transparent, hands-on projects where students could see how things worked while learning principles of electricity, magnetism, and engineering design. We piloted these with students and even brought kids to exhibit their work at the Smithsonian's Spark Lab, which was incredibly rewarding to see.

Graduate school taught me how to think critically, write effectively, and understand how knowledge is constructed. But more importantly, it reinforced my belief that the best learning happens when people can build, break, and rebuild things with their own hands.

### Finding My Place (Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, 2019-Present)
In my final year at UVA, I was invited to Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine to run their high school internship program. They offered me a job as their first-ever Fab Lab Coordinator, and I've been there ever since, now as Technology Director.

At Haystack, I've gotten to experiment with cutting-edge digital fabrication tools while working with incredibly talented artists. I developed "Haystack Labs," our Fab Lab residency program that brings together traditional craft makers and digital technologists. But equally important, I've been helping the organization transition from being primarily paper-driven to modern, cloud-first operations.

This work has helped me realize what I really love: making technology accessible and solving real problems for people who aren't necessarily "tech people." Whether it's helping a small nonprofit streamline their operations or showing an artist how to integrate digital tools into their practice, I'm energized by helping people feel empowered by technology rather than intimidated by it.

## My Values & Philosophy

### Systems Thinking, Human Scale
I'm drawn to understanding how things work at a foundational level. I like to build from primitive components and add complexity thoughtfully, rather than starting with abstractions I don't understand. But I'm also deeply committed to working at human scale—with small nonprofits, individual artists, family shops. I believe the best solutions are the ones people can actually maintain and afford long-term.

### Making the Complex Accessible
Technology shouldn't be intimidating or exploitative. I hate the idea of people using esoteric knowledge to intentionally confuse customers and charge more money. I'd rather demystify things and make them as simple and accessible as possible. Everyone deserves to feel comfortable with the digital tools in their life.

### Hands-On Learning
People learn best when they can touch, build, break, and rebuild things. This guides everything I do, whether I'm teaching a workshop or helping an organization implement new systems. We learn by doing, not just by talking about it.

### Community and Connection
Throughout my career, I've seen how powerful technology becomes when it's used to build and strengthen communities. From artist collaborations in Fab Labs to helping rural schools access modern tools, technology's greatest impact comes through fostering human connections.

### Continuous Curiosity
I've been building websites since my family had dial-up internet, working my way through everything from GeoCities to modern web development. I love testing out new tools and evaluating their quality, but I'm not loyal to any particular software company. I'll use whatever makes the most sense for the person or organization I'm working with.

### Preparing for an Uncertain Future
The world is going through major transitions—climate change, AI, economic shifts. Rural communities especially risk being left behind. I'm passionate about building resilience through accessible technology education and helping people develop dynamic skills for a changing workforce. Digital fabrication excites me because it brings together so many domains and can lead to real economic opportunities.
