### Using Engineering as a Context and Pedagogical Strategy for Engaging Students in Mathematical Modeling, Computational Thinking, and Design
**Doctoral Dissertation** | University of Virginia | 2019  
*Curriculum and Instruction: STEM Education*  
[DOI: 10.18130/v3-17q0-rw93](https://doi.org/10.18130/v3-17q0-rw93)

This dissertation explores how engineering contexts can serve as powerful pedagogical frameworks for developing students' mathematical modeling capabilities and computational thinking skills. The research demonstrates how hands-on engineering challenges can bridge abstract mathematical concepts with tangible design applications, providing new insights into effective STEM education practices.
