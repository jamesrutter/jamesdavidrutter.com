# Professional Portfolio 

This is a monorepo to contain my professional portfolio and other projects. It will be used to document almost nearly everything that I do professional so that I have a place to store and share my work. 

## Tech Stack
- Obsidian 
- Cloudflare Workers (for the portfolio website)
- Website: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Cloudflare Pages (Astro in the future?)


## Repo Structure 
For now, the repo has two main folders:
- `portfolio` - This is the entry point for the Obsidian vault. It will allow me to use Obsidian as a high quality markdown editor tool to write my content and manage it in version control. 
- `public` - This is where I will store the website that will be hosted on Cloudflare Pages. It will be built using Astro and will be hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
