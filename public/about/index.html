            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a technology translator who helps people and organizations
              make sense of the digital world without the overwhelm. My
              background is unconventional—I have deep technical knowledge from
              years of hacking on computers and building everything from
              websites to Arduino projects, combined with a genuine appreciation
              for traditional crafts and hands-on making.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I love most is being the bridge between complex technical
              concepts and practical solutions that actually work for real
              people. Whether I'm helping an artist design something on the
              computer, showing an organization how to streamline their
              workflows, or teaching someone to 3D print their first prototype,
              I get energized by those moments when something clicks and people
              realize they can control their digital tools instead of being
              controlled by them.

            <h2>My Story</h2>

              My professional journey has been anything but linear, and
              honestly, that's been the best part.

                <h3>The Audio Engineering Detour</h3>
                <span class="timeline-period">College Years</span>
                <p>
                  I started college thinking I'd become an audio engineer. I was
                  in a band throughout most of school, gigging around the Boston
                  area and Western Mass, collecting audio gear, and recording
                  friends. I even convinced my undergraduate advisor to let me
                  start a student-run recording studio in the basement of the
                  engineering department.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But somewhere along the way, I realized that recording
                  musicians professionally wasn't really for me. I discovered
                  Arduino projects and got obsessed with this idea of physical
                  computing—building circuits that could sense the environment
                  and using code to process that information. It was like
                  combining the physical and digital worlds in ways that felt
                  creative and expressive.

                <h3>The Community Arts Awakening</h3>
                <span class="timeline-period">AS220, 2010-2014</span>
                <p>
                  After graduating with my electrical engineering degree, I made
                  what many would consider an unusual choice: instead of taking
                  a high-paying corporate job, I became an AmeriCorps VISTA
                  working for AS220, a community arts organization in
                  Providence, Rhode Island. I became their Fab Lab coordinator
                  and discovered this whole world I didn't know existed—the MIT
                  Fab Lab network, digital fabrication, and a global community
                  of people actually making real things you could touch and
                  feel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At AS220, I learned that running community programming is
                  really, really hard, but also incredibly rewarding. I wore
                  many hats: recruiting teachers, developing course catalogs,
                  teaching workshops, taking on commission work. I fell in love
                  with this holistic approach to making that combined computer
                  design, prototyping, electronics, and coding all in one.

                <h3>The Academic Detour</h3>
                <span class="timeline-period"
                  >University of Virginia, 2014-2019</span
                >
                <p>
                  After AS220, my now-wife and I decided to do something
                  completely spontaneous. We moved into our 2002 Volvo station
                  wagon and lived out of the car for several months, traveling
                  around the US with no real plan. During a stop in
                  Charlottesville, Virginia, to visit family, I happened to read
                  about a UVA professor who had just landed a major NSF grant to
                  integrate digital fabrication into local schools.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For five years, I worked on developing educational kits that
                  recreated historic American inventions like the telegraph,
                  electric motor, and battery. These weren't just history
                  lessons—they were transparent, hands-on projects where
                  students could see how things worked while learning principles
                  of electricity, magnetism, and engineering design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Graduate school taught me how to think critically, write
                  effectively, and understand how knowledge is constructed. But
                  more importantly, it reinforced my belief that the best
                  learning happens when people can build, break, and rebuild
                  things with their own hands.

                <h3>Finding My Place</h3>
                <span class="timeline-period"
                  >Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, 2019-Present</span
                >
                <p>
                  In my final year at UVA, I was invited to Haystack Mountain
                  School of Crafts in Maine to run their high school internship
                  program. They offered me a job as their first-ever Fab Lab
                  Coordinator, and I've been there ever since, now as Technology
                  Director.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Haystack, I've gotten to experiment with cutting-edge
                  digital fabrication tools while working with incredibly
                  talented artists. I developed "Haystack Labs," our Fab Lab
                  residency program that brings together traditional craft
                  makers and digital technologists. But equally important, I've
                  been helping the organization transition from being primarily
                  paper-driven to modern, cloud-first operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This work has helped me realize what I really love: making
                  technology accessible and solving real problems for people who
                  aren't necessarily "tech people."

                  I'm drawn to understanding how things work at a foundational
                  level. I like to build from primitive components and add
                  complexity thoughtfully, rather than starting with
                  abstractions I don't understand. But I'm also deeply committed
                  to working at human scale—with small nonprofits, individual
                  artists, family shops.

                <p>
                  Technology shouldn't be intimidating or exploitative. I hate
                  the idea of people using esoteric knowledge to intentionally
                  confuse customers and charge more money. I'd rather demystify
                  things and make them as simple and accessible as possible.

                  People learn best when they can touch, build, break, and
                  rebuild things. This guides everything I do, whether I'm
                  teaching a workshop or helping an organization implement new
                  systems. We learn by doing, not just by talking about it.

                <p>
                  Throughout my career, I've seen how powerful technology
                  becomes when it's used to build and strengthen communities.
                  From artist collaborations in Fab Labs to helping rural
                  schools access modern tools, technology's greatest impact
                  comes through fostering human connections.

                <p>
                  I've been building websites since my family had dial-up
                  internet, working my way through everything from GeoCities to
                  modern web development. I love testing out new tools and
                  evaluating their quality, but I'm not loyal to any particular
                  software company.

                  The world is going through major transitions—climate change,
                  AI, economic shifts. Rural communities especially risk being
                  left behind. I'm passionate about building resilience through
                  accessible technology education and helping people develop
