          <h2>Who I Am</h2>
          <p>
            I currently serve as the Technology Director for Haystack Mountain
            School of Crafts, where I wear two main hats that perfectly capture
            what I love about my work. As Fab Lab Program Director, I oversee
            our digital fabrication initiatives—facilitating research and
            experimentation that brings together traditional craft makers and
            cutting-edge technology. As IT & Systems Administrator, I manage the
            technology infrastructure that keeps our community running smoothly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past five years, I've built comprehensive systems that have
            helped bring our organization into the 21st century, transitioning
            from paper-driven processes to modern digital and cloud platforms.
            But this isn't just about implementing technology for technology's
            sake—it's about making powerful tools accessible to people who
            create beautiful, meaningful work with their hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I've found my sweet spot bridging the gap
            between technical and non-technical worlds. I've established myself
            as someone who can translate complex systems into language that
            makes sense, whether I'm helping an artist understand how to use a
            3D printer or showing a nonprofit how cloud-based tools can
            transform their operations. I love getting into the weeds with a
            problem, unpacking it layer by layer until it makes complete
            sense—and then figuring out how to teach that understanding to
            others.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach has led me to learn about everything from electronics
            and programming to organizational psychology and educational theory.
            But what drives me most is the teaching, mentoring, and
            collaborating that comes with this work. Every project I take on has
            some element of community and collaboration at its core, because
            that's where technology becomes truly powerful.

              <h3>Undergraduate: Electrical & Computer System Engineering</h3>
              <span class="timeline-period">2006 - 2010</span>
              <p>
                I went to UMass Amherst for Electrical & Computer System
                Engineering. Technically, I was in Electrical Engineering, but
                they forced us to take computer system courses and learn to
                code. As a musician for most of my youth, I went into the
                program thinking I'd become a specialized audio engineer with a
                proper electrical engineering degree—maybe developing custom
                high-end boutique hardware for recording studios, or developing
                a recording studio myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                I even got to start a student-run recording studio for a brief
                period, which ultimately opened my eyes to the realities of
                music recording professionally. I didn't like it. But I did like
                making hardware, and I was introduced to several DIY audio
                electronics projects, books, and something called an Arduino
                that was just starting to become popular. I pivoted my focus to
                more DIY/maker projects that were related to people—either
                making beginning electronics tutorials or creative electronic
                projects with artists. I loved operating in the space that still
                felt relatable and accessible. "Folk electronics" is what I had
                heard it referred to as.
              </p>
              <p>
                At a certain point in college, I realized that I was not cut out
                to be a "real" engineer. Most of my friends were on path to get
                conventional industry jobs, and this really did not appeal to
                me. After nearly dropping out of the engineering school and
                switching majors, I realized there was a space for me to occupy
                and a nonconventional path for me to take. I decided to view my
                engineering education as an asset, but not my complete identity.

              <h3>Post-College: AmeriCorps VISTA & AS220</h3>
              <span class="timeline-period">2010-2014</span>
              <p>
                Entering the workforce during a recession was not great. I did
                not find a creative job in the engineering field, not for lack
                of trying, but my advisor made a life-changing recommendation
                that has led to where I am today. He told me about these spaces
                called hackerspaces and makerspaces, and even told me about one
                in Providence, RI that had an AmeriCorps VISTA position open. It
                was AS220, and the role was to become the Fab Lab coordinator
                and develop a brand new experimental program.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is where I discovered the newly established Fab Lab
                network, a spinoff from MIT's Center for Bits & Atoms, started
                by Neil Gershenfeld. I knew almost immediately that I had found
                the community I was looking for. Fab Labs were spaces that
                combined many different technologies and disciplines all
                together under one roof—not only electronics and computers, but
                also fabrication machines that could make physical objects.
              </p>
              <p>
                AS220 challenged me to really step outside the highly technical
                space of engineering school and interact with people from all
                different levels and backgrounds. Yes, there were super geeky
                members who spoke the same language, but there were also
                printmakers and photographers and artists who were curious but
                knew nothing about electronics. It really pushed me to explore
                myself as a communicator and educator. I had to learn how to
                lead, and despite having a lot of failures, I failed quickly and
                often. But working there eventually burned me out—it's a tough
                workplace and the organization was undergoing internal and
                financial challenges. After four years, two as a VISTA and two
                as the Labs Manager, I stepped away.

              <h3>Graduate School: University of Virginia</h3>
              <span class="timeline-period">2014-2019</span>
              <p>
                After AS220, my now-wife and I decided to move out of
                Providence. We didn't have any real plans, which I'm sure both
                our parents felt great about. We packed up our Volvo station
                wagon—which had the type of seats that perfectly recline into a
                flat section, great for sleeping—and we set out on a
                cross-country adventure to do some soul searching.
              </p>
              <p>
                We spent about six months on the road. During a stop in
                Charlottesville, Virginia, to visit family, I happened to read
                about a UVA professor who had just landed a major NSF grant to
                integrate digital fabrication into local schools. I reached out
                purely out of curiosity, and that professor, Dr. Glen Bull,
                ended up hiring me—but only if I enrolled in graduate school to
                get my PhD.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I did. For five years, I worked on developing educational
                STEM kits that recreated historic American inventions like the
                telegraph, electric motor, and battery. It was a partnership
                program with the Smithsonian, and was a really exciting project
                to work on throughout my graduate school experience. Graduate
                school taught me how to read research, how to write properly,
                and more about philosophy, thinking, and how people learn and
                make sense of things. It felt like it filled some gap in my
                brain that was missing critical thinking skills that engineering
                school never fully developed.

              <h3>Haystack Mountain School of Crafts</h3>
              <span class="timeline-period">2019-Present</span>
              <p>
                In my final year at UVA, I was invited to Haystack Mountain
                School of Crafts in Maine to run their high school internship
                program. They offered me a job as their first-ever Fab Lab
                Coordinator, and I've been there ever since, now as Technology
                Director.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Haystack, I've gotten to experiment with cutting-edge digital
                fabrication tools while working with incredibly talented
                artists. I developed "Haystack Labs," our Fab Lab residency
                program that brings together traditional craft makers and
                digital technologists. But equally important, I've been helping
                the organization transition from being primarily paper-driven to
                modern, cloud-first operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                This work has helped me realize what I really love: making
                technology accessible and solving real problems for people who
                aren't necessarily "tech people." Whether it's helping a small
                nonprofit streamline their operations or showing an artist how
                to integrate digital tools into their practice, I'm energized by
                helping people feel empowered by technology rather than
                intimidated by it.
